# frontend-interviews

This is the animals rating system. It allows users to see a list of animals and
sort them using different sorting rules.

You can use any libraries, es6 or vanilla javascript.

Your task is to render the `animals` array so that the user can see it and sort it.

When the user first loads the page, the `animals` array is rendered using the following HTML:

```
<ul>
  <li>Cat : rating 5</li>
  <li>Dog : rating 0</li>
  <li>Elephant : rating 4</li>
  <li>Flea : rating 1</li>
  <li>Hippo : rating 4</li>
</ul>
```

Clicking on the sorting links should rerender the list based on the instructions.

## Extra nice to haves

Add an additional button that highlights the highest rated animal in green and the lowest rated animal in red.
